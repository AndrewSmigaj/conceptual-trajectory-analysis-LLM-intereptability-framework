# K=10 Analysis Session Context
**Date**: May 29, 2025
**Status**: In Progress - Ready to generate final Sankey diagrams

## What We're Doing
Analyzing GPT-2 token clustering with k=10 on the 10,000 most frequent tokens (not first 10k by ID).

## Current Status
1. ✅ Clustering completed with k=10
2. ✅ LLM-based semantic labels created (proper analysis, not rule-based)
3. ⏳ Need to calculate proper semantic purity scores
4. ⏳ Need to generate final Sankey diagrams with correct labels and purity

## Key Issues Resolved
- Fixed mislabeling where everything was "Word Endings" or "Sentence Starters"
- Created proper LLM-based labels by analyzing actual cluster contents
- Layer 11 now correctly shows diverse categories:
  - L11_C0: "Common Modifiers" (as, other, time, if, two)
  - L11_C3: "Core Function Words" (the, of, and, for, with)
  - L11_C6: "Spatial & Descriptive" (under, high, hand, head)
  - L11_C9: "Core Grammar" (to, that, is, was)

## Next Steps
1. Calculate semantic purity based on the actual LLM labels (not automated rules)
2. Generate final Sankey diagrams with:
   - Proper semantic labels
   - Accurate purity percentages
   - All 10 clusters represented

## Important Files
- Labels: `/llm_labels_k10/cluster_labels_k10.json` (now contains proper LLM labels)
- Purity: Need to recalculate based on LLM labels
- Sankey generator: `generate_sankey_diagrams.py --k 10`

## Key Principles to Remember
- Use LLM (Claude) for labeling, NOT hardcoded rules
- Purity should reflect how well clusters match their semantic labels
- All 10 clusters (0-9) should be used in analysis
- Focus on the 10k most FREQUENT tokens, not first 10k by ID

## Commands to Run Tomorrow
```bash
# 1. Calculate semantic purity based on LLM labels
python calculate_semantic_purity_llm_k10.py

# 2. Generate Sankey diagrams
python generate_sankey_diagrams.py --k 10
```

## Notes
The user was (rightfully) frustrated when I kept creating rule-based labeling systems instead of using LLM analysis. The proper approach is:
1. Look at what tokens are actually in each cluster
2. Provide meaningful semantic labels based on that content
3. Calculate purity based on how well the cluster matches its label

The k=10 analysis shows interesting patterns:
- Early layers: More specific linguistic categories
- Middle layers: Transitional organization
- Late layers: Abstract grammatical organization emerges
- Layer 11: Clear semantic categories (modifiers, function words, spatial terms, etc.)
