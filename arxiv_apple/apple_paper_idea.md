## Abstract

We present a novel application of Concept Trajectory Analysis (CTA) to understand and correct systematic misrouting in neural network-based apple processing systems. Our analysis of 4,000 apple samples from the Apple Quality Dataset reveals that neural networks organize apples primarily by [PRIMARY ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLE - TO BE DETERMINED FROM EXPERIMENTS], causing [X%] of premium quality apples to be misrouted to juice production—a [$X.XX] per pound revenue loss. By tracking apple representations through a 12-layer processing network, we discovered [NUMBER] dominant "processing highways" that handle [X%] of routing decisions. Our key finding: [INSERT MAIN DISCOVERY ABOUT WHERE/WHY MISROUTING OCCURS]. We demonstrate that trajectory fragmentation scores above [THRESHOLD VALUE] indicate routing uncertainty requiring manual inspection. Implementation of CTA-guided interventions reduced misrouting rates from [INITIAL%] to [FINAL%], translating to [$X MILLION] annual savings for a mid-sized processor. Our open-source framework enables real-time routing correction and provides interpretable explanations for processing decisions, addressing both operational efficiency and regulatory compliance needs in food processing AI systems.

## 1. Introduction

The Pacific Northwest apple industry processes over 12 billion pounds annually, with routing decisions—fresh market versus juice production—determining up to 80% of fruit value. Premium varieties like Cosmic Crisp command $1.20-1.50 per pound in fresh markets compared to $0.08-0.12 for juice processing. Yet current AI-based sorting systems, while achieving high overall accuracy (89-94%), systematically misroute specific premium varieties, resulting in estimated annual losses exceeding $45 million regionally.

The core challenge lies not in classification accuracy but in understanding *why* neural networks make specific routing decisions. Modern apple processing facilities employ deep learning systems trained on chemical properties (brix, acidity, firmness), visual features (color, defects), and morphological characteristics (size, shape). These systems excel at binary quality decisions but struggle with variety-specific routing requirements. For instance, Cosmic Crisp apples—developed over 20 years at Washington State University—possess unique storage characteristics and optimal processing windows that differ from traditional varieties, yet neural networks frequently route them identically to standard Gala apples.

This interpretability gap has practical consequences beyond economics. Food safety regulations increasingly require algorithmic transparency, particularly for systems making irreversible processing decisions. The FDA's proposed AI/ML framework for medical devices extends conceptually to food processing, demanding "meaningful explanations" for automated decisions. Current approaches—feature importance scores, attention visualizations—fail to capture the dynamic decision-making process within neural networks.

We address this challenge by applying Concept Trajectory Analysis (CTA), a method for tracking how neural networks transform and organize information across layers. Unlike static interpretability methods, CTA reveals the complete journey from raw apple measurements to processing decisions. Our key insight: neural networks develop "processing highways"—dominant pathways through activation space that capture common routing patterns. By understanding these pathways, we can identify where and why premium varieties get misrouted.

Our contributions include:
1. **First application of CTA to agricultural processing**, revealing how neural networks organize produce by [TO BE DETERMINED: chemical similarity/visual features/other]
2. **Discovery of [NUMBER] processing highways** that determine [X%] of routing decisions, with [DESCRIBE BIAS PATTERN]
3. **Trajectory-based uncertainty quantification** where fragmentation scores predict routing errors with [X%] correlation
4. **Practical routing corrections** reducing Cosmic Crisp misrouting by [X%] while maintaining overall system accuracy
5. **Open-source implementation** enabling real-time trajectory monitoring in production environments

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Neural Networks in Agricultural Processing

Deep learning has transformed agricultural quality assessment, with applications ranging from defect detection (Zhang et al., 2022) to ripeness prediction (Kumar et al., 2023). Previous work on apple classification achieved 91-96% accuracy for variety identification (Chen et al., 2021) and 88-93% for quality grading (Park et al., 2022). However, these systems optimize for classification accuracy rather than economic outcomes, leading to systematic biases against varieties with unusual characteristics.

### 2.2 Interpretability in Food Processing AI

Regulatory pressure has driven interest in explainable AI for food systems. LIME and SHAP provide local explanations but fail to capture processing logic. Recent work on concept activation vectors (CAVs) identified quality-relevant features but couldn't explain routing decisions. Our approach differs by analyzing the complete transformation process rather than individual predictions.

### 2.3 Trajectory Analysis in Neural Networks

While trajectory analysis has been applied to language models (revealing grammatical organization) and medical diagnosis (identifying risk stratification pathways), agricultural applications remain unexplored. We extend CTA's mathematical framework to multi-modal produce data, introducing domain-specific metrics for processing applications.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Concept Trajectory Analysis for Apple Processing

CTA tracks how neural networks transform apple representations by clustering activations at each layer and following cluster assignments through the network. For layer $l$ with activation matrix $A^l \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_l}$, we apply k-means clustering to obtain assignments $c^l_i$ for each apple $i$. The trajectory $\pi_i = [c^0_i, c^1_i, ..., c^{11}_i]$ represents the apple's journey through the network.

We adapt CTA for apple processing through:
- **Quality-focused clustering**: Clusters capture different quality profiles based on chemical properties
- **Economic weighting**: Clustering metrics incorporate apple quality value differentials
- **Temporal stability**: Account for seasonal variations in apple characteristics

### 3.2 Neural Architecture

Our processing network uses a deep feedforward architecture to process chemical features:

```python
class AppleProcessingNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        
        # 12-layer feedforward network
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            # Input layer
            nn.Linear(8, 64),      # L0: 8 chemical features from Apple Quality Dataset
            nn.BatchNorm1d(64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            # Feature extraction layers
            nn.Linear(64, 128),    # L1
            nn.BatchNorm1d(128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            nn.Linear(128, 256),   # L2
            nn.BatchNorm1d(256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            nn.Linear(256, 512),   # L3
            nn.BatchNorm1d(512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.3),
            
            # Quality assessment layers
            nn.Linear(512, 512),   # L4
            nn.BatchNorm1d(512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            nn.Linear(512, 256),   # L5
            nn.BatchNorm1d(256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            nn.Linear(256, 128),   # L6
            nn.BatchNorm1d(128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            nn.Linear(128, 64),    # L7
            nn.BatchNorm1d(64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            # Processing decision layers
            nn.Linear(64, 32),     # L8
            nn.BatchNorm1d(32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            nn.Linear(32, 16),     # L9
            nn.BatchNorm1d(16),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            nn.Linear(16, 8),      # L10
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            nn.Linear(8, 2)        # L11: Binary routing (fresh/juice)
        )
```

### 3.3 Trajectory Metrics

We quantify trajectory behavior through:

**Fragmentation Score (F)**: Measures path diversity within variety groups
$$F = 1 - \frac{\text{count of most common path}}{\text{total paths in variety}}$$

**Economic Divergence (ED)**: Quantifies when high-value varieties diverge from standard pathways
$$ED = \frac{1}{|L|}\sum_{l \in L} \mathbb{1}[\pi^{\text{premium}}_l \neq \pi^{\text{standard}}_l]$$

**Convergence Layer (CL)**: First layer where premium and standard varieties share clusters
$$CL = \min\{l : c^l_{\text{premium}} = c^l_{\text{standard}}\}$$

## 4. Experimental Setup

### 4.1 Dataset Construction

**Apple Quality Dataset (Kaggle)**:
- 4,000 samples with chemical and physical measurements
- Features: Size, Weight, Sweetness, Crunchiness, Juiciness, Ripeness, Acidity, Quality
- Binary quality labels: good/bad (to be used for routing decisions)

**Processing Route Assignment**:
Based on the quality label and feature thresholds, we assign apples to two primary routes:
- **Fresh Market**: Quality = 'good' (higher value)
- **Juice Processing**: Quality = 'bad' (lower value)

**Note**: The dataset does not include variety information, so we will simulate the premium variety misrouting problem by identifying high-quality apples with specific feature profiles that get incorrectly routed.

### 4.2 Data Preprocessing

```python
# Chemical feature preprocessing
chemical_features = [
    'sweetness',      # Brix levels

    'juiciness',      # Water content
    'firmness',       # Pressure test (Newtons)
    'size',           # Diameter (mm)
    'weight',         # Mass (g)
    'ripeness_score'  # Maturity index
]

# Visual feature extraction from MinneApple
visual_features = [
    'surface_defect_ratio',    # % of surface with defects
    'color_uniformity',        # Std dev of color channels
    'shape_regularity',        # Deviation from ideal sphere
    'bruise_count',           # Number of dark spots
    'russeting_score',        # Skin texture abnormality
    'stem_bowl_depth'         # Morphological feature
]

# Normalize all features
scaler = StandardScaler()
normalized_features = scaler.fit_transform(combined_features)
```

    def extract_trajectories(self, apple_batch):
        """Track apples through processing pipeline"""
        trajectories = []
        activations = {}
        
        # Register hooks to capture activations
        hooks = []
        for name, module in self.model.named_modules():
            if name in self.layer_names:
                hook = module.register_forward_hook(
                    lambda m, i, o, name=name: activations.update({name: o.detach()})
                )
                hooks.append(hook)
        
        # Forward pass
        _ = self.model(apple_batch)
        
        # Cluster activations at each layer
        for layer_idx, layer_name in enumerate(self.layer_names):
            layer_acts = activations[layer_name]
            
            # Determine optimal k using Gap statistic
            if layer_name not in self.clustering_cache:
                k_optimal = self.determine_optimal_k(layer_acts)
                self.clustering_cache[layer_name] = k_optimal
            else:
                k_optimal = self.clustering_cache[layer_name]
            
            # Cluster
            clusters = KMeans(n_clusters=k_optimal, random_state=42).fit_predict(layer_acts)
            
            # Create unique cluster IDs
            cluster_ids = [f"L{layer_idx}_C{c}" for c in clusters]
            trajectories.append(cluster_ids)
        
        # Remove hooks
        for hook in hooks:
            hook.remove()
        
        # Format as list of trajectories
        return list(zip(*trajectories))
```

### 4.5 Evaluation Metrics

Beyond standard accuracy, we measure:
- **Misrouting rate**: Premium apples sent to juice processing
- **Economic loss**: Revenue difference between actual and optimal routing
- **Trajectory stability**: Consistency of pathways across batches
- **Fragmentation correlation**: Relationship between F-score and errors
